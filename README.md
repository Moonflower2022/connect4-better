# connect4-general

A better connect 4 website where you can play against bots implemented with generalized algorithms.

# features

* `index.html`: normal website where you can play against one of the bots.
* `1v1.html`: runs one game between two bots on display, and then runs 1000 more and keeps track of the stats.

# todo

* ui
  * settings
    * thinking time for mcts
    * search depth for minimax
  * save state
  * new game
  * show where your marker would be placed on the board
  * worker for no lag
* optimize with bit board
  * 2^42 is only like 13 digits (not very long)
